### Abstract

This presentation offers a comprehensive exploration of artificial intelligence (AI) and its trajectory from broad, foundational principles to specialized applications at the technological forefront. Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.

Diving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology—edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.

Concluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.


## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?

### Abstract

People talk about “Linux containers” forgetting that the part actually called “Linux”, the kernel, isn’t in the container.

But what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?

Let’s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let’s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let’s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let’s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.

We’d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We’ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.

There’ll be demos, there’ll be prizes, there’ll be cheers, there’ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we’d love to share it with you.
