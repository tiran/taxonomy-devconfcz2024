Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers.

Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers.

As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers.

As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers.

As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

        "instruction": "How can one build a microservices architecture using Kubernetes?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "To build a microservices architecture using Kubernetes, you should first understand how to deploy and manage individual services as containers using the Kubernetes container orchestration platform. You should also be familiar with how to use Kubernetes cluster resources like network policies, storage volumes, and secret keys in order to securely interconnect your services.\n\nOnce you have a basic understanding of how to deploy and connect microservices on Kubernetes, you can follow best practices for service design and communication patterns that are commonly used in microservices architecture. This includes using RESTful APIs, gRPC or other protocols that allow for easy and flexible intercommunication between services.\n\nIt is also important to use a cloud-native approach to building your microservices architecture on Kubernetes by leveraging the built-in capabilities of the platform like horizontal scaling, self healing, load balancing and automated rolling updates. This will help you to build a more resilient, scalable and maintainable system that can handle traffic spikes, failures and other unexpected events.\n\nFurthermore, it is recommended to use a declarative configuration management approach for your Kubernetes services, such as Helm or Kube-Pipelines, in order to keep your deployment specifications organized and up-to-date. This will help you to manage complex configurations that involve multiple microservices with ease and confidence.\n```",

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers.

As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI.

Once the container image is built, any changes made to it are not saved and instead a new image is created with those changes applied. This ensures that each container instance is always in a known good state. It also provides several benefits such as:\n  - Automated rollbacks: If a problem arises, you can easily roll back to the previous version of your container\n  - Reduced complexity: There are fewer moving parts and less to manage\n  - Enhanced security: Immutable containers are more difficult to exploit as they contain no unpatched vulnerabilities",

Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears.

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image?

Starting with an introduction to AI and its evolution, the presentation transitions to discussing the applications and impact of AI, we spotlight the transformative effects on sectors such as healthcare, finance, automotive, and entertainment, while also addressing the ethical and societal implications that accompany widespread AI adoption.\n\nDiving deeper, the presentation shifts focus towards the frontier of AI technology\u2014edge AI. Here, we uncover the significance of bringing AI processing closer to the data source, highlighting the benefits of reduced latency and enhanced privacy, alongside the challenges faced in implementation. Through real-world examples, attendees will gain insights into how edge AI is being integrated into smart devices, autonomous vehicles, and industrial predictive maintenance.\n\nConcluding with a look at future directions, we speculate on emerging trends and potential breakthroughs in AI, including the role of quantum computing and the importance of AI governance. Designed to be both informative and thought-provoking, this keynote aims to provide a holistic view of AI's current state and its boundless future possibilities, encouraging a dialogue on how we, as a society, can navigate the ethical, technological, and practical challenges ahead. This presentation is a call to action for professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts to reflect on the implications of AI advancements and to participate in shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential and addresses global challenges.\n\n\n## Keynote: What if you could boot a container?\n\n2024-06-14, 09:30\u201310:05 (Europe/Prague), D105 (capacity 300)\n\n### Speakers\n\n- Dan Walsh\n- Stef Walter\n- Colin Walters\n\n### Abstract\n\nPeople talk about \u201cLinux containers\u201d forgetting that the part actually called \u201cLinux\u201d, the kernel, isn\u2019t in the container.\n\nBut what if you could include a kernel in your container image, and what if you could boot that image? What if you could commit the definition of your whole Linux system to version control. What if you could push around images for the entire system, just like you can with containers. And finally: what if this was a documented and tested first class workflow supported by your Linux OS/distribution?\n\nLet\u2019s take the practices, tooling and standards that have grown around OCI containers for applications and apply them to the operating system. Let\u2019s deploy and update the host via those same patterns, rather than individual fine grained packages. As we emphasize derived, consumer-owned builds, let\u2019s make it ergonomic to create and maintain a complete trust chain all the way from the boot loader through the OS right through to existing containerized apps. Let\u2019s bring immutability, auto-updating, resetting along as well.\n\nWe\u2019d like to show how this can work practically, with real world applications, and built out of the packages we have today. We\u2019ll look at the projects that are working on various parts of this puzzle.\n\nThere\u2019ll be demos, there\u2019ll be prizes, there\u2019ll be cheers, there\u2019ll be tears. This work has gotten us excited about the operating system again, and we\u2019d love to share it with you."
